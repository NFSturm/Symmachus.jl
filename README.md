> We see the same stars, the sky is shared by all, the same world surrounds us. What does it matter what wisdom a person uses to seek for the truth? - Quintus Aurelius Symmachus (342 - 402/3 CE)

ðŸ’¡ This project is realized as a Master thesis at Nova School of Business and Economics, Lisbon under the supervision of Prof. Leid Zejnilovic. 

ðŸ“„ Symmachus is a semi-supervised Machine Learning system. The idea is to use a small, but expressive dataset containing phrases containing political convictions and normative statements from the Portuguese parliament and gradually building a bigger dataset. Using XGBoost, the dataset is used to broadcast appropriate labels to the entire dataset. Finally, we analyze the adherence of discourse by political actors to parliamentary actions.
